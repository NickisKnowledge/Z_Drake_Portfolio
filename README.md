# Z Drake Portfolio
**Bienvenido a mi historia!** <br />
(Welcome to my story!)

I'm glad you're interested in seeing how I build my Portfolio! I've used the two languages I love, *Ruby and JavaScript*. This app operates with Ruby on Rails and jQuery to showcase my current projects as well as give you, the viewer a little **historia** (history) about myself.

**_Además, gracias para su interés sobre yo!_**<br />
(Again, thanks for your interest about me!)<br />
